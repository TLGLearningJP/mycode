This is still a work in progress overall. I have a lot of the broadstrokes. 
I need to adapt the user_input from the html submission buttons to adapt the end of the url and ultimately make the api call. 

From there the api calls can create values for the variables necessary to generate a dynamic page. The format of the information is there already.
